## Handling Missing Data in Daily Activity Sensing

To precisely recognize Activities of Daily Living (ADL), multimodal sensing technique using multiple sensors can be applied. However, such systems are likely to encounter data loss, either because of broken sensors, asynchronize sampling rate, and lost of sensing target because of hardware constraints. Even if sampled data are complete, missing data could also appear by merging two sparse tables. The general data–refilling method includes filling with 0’s or a special number, such as filling ‘-1’ in columns consist of non-negative integers. However, such constant-number filling methods may add noise to dataset, and resulting in dragging performance of machine learning algorithms. Some other methods such as 1NN and SMOTE, are neighbor-based. By repeating or combing linearly of neighboring data points, such methods, however, ignore background distributions of data. 
With the aid of deep learning, we can implement non-linear data-refilling method, including Autoencoder and General Adversarial Networks, to ADL recognition. Using such methods can help to recover all features with only partial features and overcome data loss problems. In this project, we are going to explore various data refilling methods to several ADL datasets and find out what network can best fit to solve the problem.
